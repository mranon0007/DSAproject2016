It was a year of time travel in global sports. While revisiting the past was often a downer, with the McLaren reports and Olympic retesting confirming the grand scale of recent cheating, living in the moment was routinely a joy ride.

There were times — as the buzzer-beaters and long-delayed gratification piled up — when it felt as if sport, amid the justifiable negativity, was trying desperately to prove to wavering millennials and everyone else that it was still worth saving by pulling out all the stops, all the most irresistible stories and completed quests it could muster.

In Europe, Leicester City somehow held off the best talent that richer clubs with worldwide followings could deploy, becoming the unlikeliest and most endearing Premier League champion in memory. This was a club that had avoided relegation the previous season only with a very late surge. But after signing the Italian manager Claudio Ranieri and the deft and indefatigable French midfielder N’Golo Kante, Leicester City overcame preseason odds that were 5,000 to 1 and won the title.

In North America, the Chicago Cubs were no Cinderellas — they were widely viewed as favorites from April to October. But they still had a cargo hold of historical baggage to unload before ending their 108-year wait for another World Series win. That deliverance came in the same year that LeBron James completed his mission in Cleveland, leading the Cavaliers to their first N.B.A. title.
