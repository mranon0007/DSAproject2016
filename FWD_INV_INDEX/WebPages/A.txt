escape. “I’m fearful The last time Steve Kerr was in Beirut, his birthplace, with the bombs pounding the runway and the assassination of his father six months away, he left by car.The airport was closed. There was talk of taking a cruise ship to Cyprus, or accompanying an ambassader on a helicopter to Tel Aviv or even crossing into Israel on an illegal public bus. A military plane headed to Cairo had an empty seat, but it went to someone else.
